## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository of Smarty-Gemini Agent, a sophisticated agent designed to meet a wide array of user needs through advanced language understanding and decision-making capabilities. Powered by Google's cutting-edge Gemini-pro Large Language Model (LLM), this agent integrates a suite of special tools to facilitate searches across various platforms including DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Google Scholar, ArXiv, and PubMed, alongside the capability to read and interpret PDF documents. 

## Features
- **Advanced Language Understanding**: At its core, the Gemini-Pro Agent leverages Google's Gemini-pro LLM, ensuring a deep comprehension of human language.
- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: The agent autonomously decides the most suitable tool or response for each query, optimizing user experience.
- **Versatile Search Options**: With integrated search capabilities across DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Google Scholar, ArXiv, and PubMed, users can find accurate information across the web and academic journals.
- **PDF Interpretation**: Ability to read and analyze PDF documents, extracting valuable insights and answers.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built using the Streamlit library, making it accessible for non-technical users.
- **Powered by Langchain**: Utilizes the Langchain library for efficient handling of API and LLM calls.
